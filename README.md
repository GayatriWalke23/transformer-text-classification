# Transformer-based Text Classification with PyTorch

## Introduction

This project leverages a Transformer model implemented in PyTorch to classify text from the `ag_news_csv` dataset. The dataset includes news articles categorized into four classes. The model architecture includes embedding layers, positional encoding, transformer encoder layers, dropout, and a final linear layer for classification.

## Results

- **Training Accuracy**: 85%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 86%
- **Test Accuracy**: 87%

These results indicate that the model generalizes well to unseen data, effectively classifying news articles into their respective categories.

## Code

You can find the code for the entire project in the transformer-text-classification.ipynb file.
## Detailed Report

A comprehensive report detailing the model architecture, training process, evaluation metrics, and performance graphs is available in `report.pdf`.
